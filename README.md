## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

My motivation was to build a project that can allow for simple and convenient organization. I built a usable application that allows for the saving and deleting of notes. 


## Installation

The installation was a simple back-end code creation. I created a store.js to implement data storage. I then created api and html routes to create the data link for the api and html pages.

## Usage

To use this application.. Simply click the + icon to create a new note with a title and body test. Then click the save button to list the saved note to the side panel. All notes can be deleted with the trash can icon on the right side of the side panel.

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
